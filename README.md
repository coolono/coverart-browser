#coverart-browser v0.8
================

Browse your coverart albums in Rhythmbox v2.96 - Rhythmbox v2.98*

---------- 

v0.9 of the plugin is now gearing up for its release - we just need testers.  
If you are a rhythmbox user from v2.96 through to the git verson of RB (upcoming 3.0), 
please grab a copy of the master branch (https://github.com/fossfreedom/coverart-browser/blob/master/README.md) and 
test it out.  Let us know the "good/bad and the ugly" by creating an issue on the projects GitHub page 
(https://github.com/fossfreedom/coverart-browser/issues?milestone=8&state=open) Cheers.

Also - if you are a translator - please update your language translations so that we can test that component as well

##Summary: whats new in this release

 - Export whole albums and embed coverart in the album tracks so that (where required) phones/tablets can display coverart correctly
 - Drag & Drop CoverArt icons onto playlists and sources (such as a phone) so that all tracks for an album are added

*note* - remember to use the *Portable Players - Ipod* and/or *Portable Players - MTP* plugin if your phone requires these to sync music

 - separated coverart search into separate plugin (this is now a prerequisite) - https://github.com/fossfreedom/coverart-search-providers
 - New light & dark theme buttons to complement light & dark desktop themes
 - optional flat-button toolbar style
 - revised popup menu style genre & playlist windows when number of entries would exceed the desktop height
 - Use album and album-artist sort order tags for sorting if these values are utilised
 - Play from Cover-view and Track view instead of queuing & playing
 - Allow user-defined genre names to be created mapped against default system genre icons
 - Allow user-defined genre icons to be displayed. These can override system genre icons if required
 - Support for other plugins via right-click menu options in a similar manner as the Library Browser - 

 OpenContainingFolder, SendFirst, Send Track, LastFMExtension - Fingerprinter, FileOrganizer, lLyrics, WikipediaSearch

 N.B. if NOT using my PPA then ensure you have the very latest version of the plugins installed.

 - for developers - doxygen documentation: http://fossfreedom.github.io/coverart-browser/classes.html

*How it works:*

 - Click the new CoverArt source button (left hand side of screen)
 - Albums are displayed as clickable buttons containing their album cover
 - Right click menu option to play, queue & search for coverart for an album.
 
 - https://github.com/fossfreedom/coverart-browser/wiki/how-to-for-version-0.8

*How to install:*

for debian & debian-based distros such as Ubuntu & Mint

    sudo apt-get install git gettext python-mako python-lxml

for fedora and similar:

    yum install git gettext python-mako python-lxml
    
for opensuse

    sudo zypper in git gettext-runtime python-mako python-lxml typelib-1_0-WebKit-3_0
    
NOTE - for opensuse 12.3 please do NOT install typelib-1_0-WebKit-3_0.  You also need to make
the following code change to enable the plugin to work:

 - https://github.com/fossfreedom/coverart-browser/wiki/OpenSuse-12.3-WebKit-issue


Then install the plugin:

<pre>
rm -rf ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/coverart_browser
git clone https://github.com/fossfreedom/coverart-browser.git
cd coverart-browser
sh ./install.sh
</pre>

Note 1 - the CoverArt Browser plugin also requires installing the following plugin:

 - https://github.com/fossfreedom/coverart-search-providers
 
*Note 2 - Due to upstream changes v0.8 of this plugin does NOT work with rhythmbox 2.99.  

However, we have made fairly extensive changes in the master (testing) branch.  We would love RB2.99 users to
test this out and give us feedback.  Thanks.

*For Ubuntu 12.04 & 12.10:* 

V0.8 is now available in my rhythmbox PPA - installation instructions in this AskUbuntu Q&A:

http://askubuntu.com/questions/147942/how-do-i-install-third-party-rhythmbox-plugins

Note - installing the package `rhythmbox-plugin-coverart-browser` will also install `rhythmbox-plugin-coverart-search`
